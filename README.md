# Old Deliverables for CMPSC 201 (Fall 2025)

This reference contains a list of all weekly deliverables for the fall 2025
semester of CMPSC 201. Since the course's GitHub organization main page only
contains the current week's deliverables, you can reference this list of old
and past-due assignments if you're a) curious about the road we've traveled so
far, or b) trying to make up some work with a token.

## Commit Week One Deliverables (8/26)

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Tuesday @ 11:59pm*, complete the
  [introductory survey](https://forms.gle/6rm7CV8u9KViWBZg7)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to the
  week's Discord thread

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Thursday @ 11:59pm*, create a team repository within
  our course organization that all team members have access to, and populate the
  README.md with a code of conduct

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, create an individual repository
  within our course organization, and (using whatever organizational structure
  you deem fit) add a single markdown file that has a 200 word (minimum) answer
  to the following prompt:
  
  > Why am I taking CMPSC 201? How does this course and its stated learning
  > objectives fit into my academic/professional/personal goals?

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within the same repository that
  you'll store your reflection entries in, add an image file exported from
  [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that denotes at least three things you
  already know (or at least think you know) about the course topic:
