# Old Deliverables for CMPSC 201 (Fall 2025)

This reference contains a list of all weekly deliverables for the fall 2025
semester of CMPSC 201. Since the course's GitHub organization main page only
contains the current week's deliverables, you can reference this list of old
and past-due assignments if you're a) curious about the road we've traveled so
far, or b) trying to make up some work with a token.

## Commit Week One Deliverables (8/26)

  another; more specifically, draw eight shapes (one for each part) and ensure
  each shape has at least one arrow noting how it's related to at least one
  other part, like:

  hits every option from the original program in whatever order/amounts you
  like, and be sure to display intermediate outputs from every hardcoded user
  selection

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file with a 200 word (minimum) response to
  the following prompt:

  the second learning objective for this course:

  > Effectively use programming language constructs to design correct,
  > efficient, and well-tested programs in multiple programming languages,
  > including but not limited to Java.

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file with a 200 word (minimum) response to

  > have been dealt out at this point. With this in mind, take your current
  > overall score from the latest `gradebook` update and multiply your current
  > score by 4. Look at the grade conversion chart in the syllabus and determine
  > what grade that score would earn--that's the grade that you're more or less
  > on track for. Is this a grade that you're happy with? Regardless of whether
  > you're satisfied with that potential grade or not, answer these two

  generalized mechanics of how a programming language is interpeted; these
  mechanics should tie back to your map for last week about scanning (that is,
  don't clear your canvas); additionally, this time there are no requirements
  around number of entities used, but credit will only be given to those that
  comprehensively present a general understanding of how language grammars
  "work"

## Commit Week Six Deliverables (10/6)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight

    - C: Unreachable code - code after a `return`, `break`, or `continue` that
      can't be accessed

    - D: Empty blocks - `if`, `for`, and `while` statements that only contain
      `pass`

    - E: Long functions - functions that contain more than *N* statements

    - F: Naming conventions - enforcing `snake_case` for variables & functions

    - G: Magic numbers - "bare" constants used instead of named variables

    - H: Docstring enforcement - require a docstring for all functions
    
    - I: Too many parameters - detect functions with more than *N* arguments

  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that visualizes how the
  Lox `Parser` works; this should connect to the maps for scanning and grammars
  (do not clear your canvas) and should also use at least ten shapes/entities
  to illustrate the `Parser`
