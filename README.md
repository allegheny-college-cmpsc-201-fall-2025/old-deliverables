# Old Deliverables for CMPSC 201 (Fall 2025)

This reference contains a list of all weekly deliverables for the fall 2025
semester of CMPSC 201. Since the course's GitHub organization main page only
contains the current week's deliverables, you can reference this list of old
and past-due assignments if you're a) curious about the road we've traveled so
far, or b) trying to make up some work with a token.

## Commit Week One Deliverables (8/26)

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Tuesday @ 11:59pm*, complete the
  [introductory survey](https://forms.gle/6rm7CV8u9KViWBZg7)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight
  (meaning something that one of your peers has not already shared) to this
  week's Discord thread about domain-specific languages

- **Team Deliverable:** *by Thursday @ 11:59pm*, create a team repository within
  our course organization that all team members have access to, and populate the
  README.md with a code of conduct

  within our course organization, and (using whatever organizational structure
  you deem fit) add a single markdown file that has a 200 word (minimum) answer

  > Why am I taking CMPSC 201? How does this course and its stated learning
  > objectives fit into my academic/professional/personal goals?

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within the same repository that
  you'll store your reflection entries in, add an image file exported from
  [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that denotes at least three things you
  already know (or at least think you know) about the course topic:

  be a useful resource for getting your workspace set up)

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Friday @ 7:59pm*, demo a toy Java program for
  the professor (and push it to your individual repository); it doesn't matter
  what the program *does*, but the code must include these three things at
  minimum:

    [arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.am/java/java_operators.html#gsc.tab=0)

  - some control flow logic, utilizing either
    [if](https://www.w3schools.am/java/java_conditions.html#gsc.tab=0),

    [method](https://www.w3schools.am/java/java_methods.html#gsc.tab=0) beyond
    a `main`

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a 200 word (minimum) answer to the following prompt:

  > *different*.

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add an image file exported from
  [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that identifies the eight parts of a

  another; more specifically, draw eight shapes (one for each part) and ensure
  each shape has at least one arrow noting how it's related to at least one
  other part, like:

  hits every option from the original program in whatever order/amounts you
  like, and be sure to display intermediate outputs from every hardcoded user
  selection

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file with a 200 word (minimum) response to
  the following prompt:
  
  > Before our performance review sessions next week, you now have a chance to

    words (per toy) that addresses the following:

    - How did the language lend itself to the implementation of that toy?

    - What obstacles did you encounter?

    - If you could do this project again would you build this toy in a different

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, create a
  `learning-objectives` folder in your individual repository, and add a file
  `learning-objective-two.md` that contains a 500 word statement detailing

  the second learning objective for this course:

  > Effectively use programming language constructs to design correct,
  > efficient, and well-tested programs in multiple programming languages,
  > including but not limited to Java.

- **Reflection Entry:** *by Saturday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a Markdown (`.md`) file with a 200 word (minimum) response to
  the following prompt:

  > have been dealt out at this point. With this in mind, take your current
  > overall score from the latest `gradebook` update and multiply your current
  > score by 4. Look at the grade conversion chart in the syllabus and determine
  > what grade that score would earn--that's the grade that you're more or less
  > on track for. Is this a grade that you're happy with? Regardless of whether
  > you're satisfied with that potential grade or not, answer these two

  conversation about context-free grammars for the point)

- **Individual Deliverable:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, write a series of (at least 25) rules for an activity in the style

  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that visualizes the
  generalized mechanics of how a programming language is interpeted; these
  mechanics should tie back to your map for last week about scanning (that is,
  don't clear your canvas); additionally, this time there are no requirements
  around number of entities used, but credit will only be given to those that
  comprehensively present a general understanding of how language grammars
  "work"

## Commit Week Six Deliverables (10/6)

- **Discord Discussion:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, post a novel insight

    note the specific individuals responsible for the deadline as well as the
    date the task should be achieved by

    - 3/4 team members on Monday (3 for Cooler, 4 for Fornite)

    - 2 team members on Tuesday

    - 1 team member on Thursday

  - The selection of five linting rules that the team will tackle from the below
    menu:

      outer scope variable name

    - C: Unreachable code - code after a `return`, `break`, or `continue` that
      can't be accessed

    - D: Empty blocks - `if`, `for`, and `while` statements that only contain
      `pass`

    - E: Long functions - functions that contain more than *N* statements

    - F: Naming conventions - enforcing `snake_case` for variables & functions

    - G: Magic numbers - "bare" constants used instead of named variables

    - H: Docstring enforcement - require a docstring for all functions
    
    - I: Too many parameters - detect functions with more than *N* arguments

  > understanding, what will the final deliverable look like? How will it
  > logically function?

- **Mapmaking Task:** *by Wednesday @ 11:59pm*, within your individual
  repository, add a `.png` image file (no other file types will be counted)
  exported from [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that visualizes how the
  Lox `Parser` works; this should connect to the maps for scanning and grammars
  (do not clear your canvas) and should also use at least ten shapes/entities
  to illustrate the `Parser`

## Build Week Two Deliverables (10/13)

- **Tree-Walk Linter:** for up to five possible points, work with your team to
  successfully demonstrate a linter that can take a source code input and report
  on style breaches based on five distinct linting rules; one point each will be
  awarded for meeting the following criteria:

  - Demonstrates clear use of the Python `ast` module in achieving the objective

  - Successfully reads in a source code file as an input and reports *where* the
    problem(s) were and *what* rule(s) were breached

  - Clearly shows the ability to catch all five selected linting rule cases

  - Is presented alongside extemporaneous discussion stemming from the
    highlights of the `project-reflection.md` file that addresses the following
    questions:

    - How did the `ast` module assist in this endeavor? (~250 words)

    - Would this have been possible without the use of an AST? If so, would the
      alternative approach be more/less effective? If not, *why*? (~250 words)

  instructor in a one-on-one conversation during your scheduled session about
  your performance thus far in the semester:

    - Three points will be derived from responding to high-level questions about
